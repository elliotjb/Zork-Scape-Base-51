<p>24h ago I decided to sneak into the mythical "base 51" and take pictures. The truth is that I do not prepare well and most of all I set out to see what he found, but could never imagine that he would discover the existence of extraterrestrials. I got to make some pictures of a spacecraft that was in one of the hangars but because they do not turn off the flash detectors me and the soldier locked me in a room that seemed to be used in interrogations. Hours passed and no one came to talk to me, then speakers sounded the alarm and a message saying that one of the "thing" had escaped and called for everyone to leave the building. I guess they forgot about me because no one answered the door, then the lights went out and immediately emergency lights came on but was equally dark. Hear a lot of noise coming from the room side, there was a silence and suddenly a roar that seemed to be in front of me and I could see that the door was on the floor with a person. At that time I decided to get out of there, but first have to get my camera.</p>
