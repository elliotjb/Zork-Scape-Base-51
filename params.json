{"name":"Zork \"Scape Base 51\"","tagline":"MY Zork!","body":"## Welcome to the Zork \"Scape Base 51\"!\r\n\r\n\r\n### INTRODUCTION\r\nI created a similar game based on the popular Zork!\r\n\r\n### Game\r\n24h ago I decided to sneak into the mythical \"base 51\" and take pictures. The truth is that I do not prepare well and most of all I set out to see what he found, but could never imagine that he would discover the existence of extraterrestrials. I got to make some pictures of a spacecraft that was in one of the hangars but because they do not turn off the flash detectors me and the soldier locked me in a room that seemed to be used in interrogations. Hours passed and no one came to talk to me, then speakers sounded the alarm and a message saying that one of the \"thing\" had escaped and called for everyone to leave the building. I guess they forgot about me because no one answered the door, then the lights went out and immediately emergency lights came on but was equally dark. Hear a lot of noise coming from the room side, there was a silence and suddenly a roar that seemed to be in front of me and I could see that the door was on the floor with a person. At that time I decided to get out of there, but first have to get my camera.\r\n\r\n### Original Zork!\r\n[Link to original Zork!](http://iplayif.com/?story=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifarchive.org%2Fif-archive%2Fgames%2Fzcode%2Fzdungeon.z5)\r\n\r\n### Game map\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elliotjb/Zork-Scape-Base-51/master/Zork_map.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n[contact me](https://github.com/elliotjb) and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.\r\n[My Zork-Wiki](https://github.com/elliotjb/Zork-Scape-Base-51/wiki/My-Zork!:-%E2%80%9CScape-Base-51!%E2%80%9D)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
